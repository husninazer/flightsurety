# FlightSurety

FlightSurety is a sample application project for Udacity's Blockchain course. The DAPP lets passengers purchase flight insurances prior to flight departure through the DAPP and get payback incase the flight gets delayed/cancelled. The project has stages before it can be used. The participating actors are airlines and passengers. At the start, up to 4 airlines can participate directly by sending a fund of 10 ether (fixed) and the next airlines to be registered has to get at least 50% vote from the existing participating airlines.
